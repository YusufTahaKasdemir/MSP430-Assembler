## 🚀 About the Project

This project provides a sophisticated toolset designed to facilitate **assembly language programming** on the MSP430 microcontroller. Developers can write, assemble, simulate, and directly upload assembly code to physical MSP430 hardware.  
A user-friendly **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** simplifies debugging and provides visual insights into microcontroller behavior.

---

## ✨ Features

✅ **Custom Assembler:** Converts MSP430 assembly code into machine-readable executable code.  
✅ **Visual Simulator:** Interactive simulator built with Tkinter, visualizing LED states, registers, and memory operations.  
✅ **Hardware Bridge:** Python-based bridge (`msp430_bridge.py`) enabling communication between simulator and physical MSP430 devices.  
✅ **Hardware Integration Module:** Handles serial communication with MSP430 boards via `msp430_hardware.py`.  
✅ **User-Friendly GUI:** GUI (`MSP430v1.9.py`, `hardware_integration_test.py`) for code input, compilation, simulation, and hardware testing.  
✅ **Advanced Directive Support:** Supports `.bss`, `.data`, `.text`, `.word`, `.byte` for efficient memory and section management.  
✅ **Conditional Assembly & Macros:** Allows flexible, modular code with conditional assembly and macro definitions.

## 🛠️ Installation

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x  
- `pyserial` library for hardware integration  

### **Setup Steps**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MSP430-Development-Environment.git
cd MSP430-Development-Environment
pip install pyserial
```

⚠️ Ensure you have the necessary drivers installed for your MSP430 board (e.g., Texas Instruments USB UART drivers).

## 💡 Usage

To launch the development environment, run:

```bash
python MSP430v1.9.py
```

### **Capabilities via GUI**

- **Assembly Code Input:** Write MSP430 assembly code in the left panel.  
- **Assemble & Convert:** Compile to machine code (Hex and Binary outputs displayed).  
- **Simulation:** Run code on the visual simulator, observe LEDs, registers, and memory in real-time.  
- **Hardware Integration:** Access from the "Hardware" menu to scan devices, upload code, and establish serial communication.  
- **Save/Load:** Save or open assembly code files for future editing.
